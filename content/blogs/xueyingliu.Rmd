# Task 2: `gapminder` country comparison

You have seen the `gapminder` dataset that has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) 
# look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

Your task is to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` you come from.

I have created the `country_data` and `continent_data` with the code below.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "China") 

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country you chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. You should also use `geom_point()` to see the actual data points and `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)` to plot the underlying trendlines. You need to remove the comments **\#** from the lines below for your code to run.

```{r, lifeExp_China}
 plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
   NULL 

 plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_China1}
 plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "China_life expextancy over time",
       x = "year",
       y = "lifeExp") +
   NULL


 plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* you come from. (Hint: map the `country` variable to the colour aesthetic. You also want to map `country` to the `group` aesthetic, so all points for each country are grouped together).

```{r lifeExp_Asia}
 ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x =year  , y = lifeExp, colour=country , group = country))+
   geom_point()+ 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
 ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour=continent ))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends
   NULL
```

Given these trends, what can you say about life expectancy since 1952? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> For China, the life expectancy has been growing since 1952. However, the speed of the growth of life expectancy in China decreased in the late 1970s. I think this is because since 1978, China's Reform and Opening-Up has begun, which has changed people's lifestyle and living standards to a certain extent and brought about the changes in the speed of growth of life expectancy.
>
> In Asia, the life expectancy in most countries has been growing since 1952. Since late 1960s, Japan has become the country with the highest life expectancy in Asia. Maybe it is because Japanese eats more healthily than people in other countries.
>
> As for different continents, the life expectancy for countries in Europe varies less, and the life expectancy for countries in Africa and Asia varies more. One possible reason is that most of the countries in Europe are well developed, and there is significant difference in the development levels in countries in Africa and Asia, which results in the difference of life expectancy.

# Task 3: Brexit vote analysis

We will have a look at the results of the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK. First we read the data using `read_csv()` and have a quick glimpse at the data

```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# read data directly off github repo
brexit_results <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kostis-christodoulou/am01/master/data/brexit_results.csv")


glimpse(brexit_results)
```

The data comes from [Elliott Morris](https://www.thecrosstab.com/), who cleaned it and made it available through his [DataCamp class on analysing election and polling data in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r).

Our main outcome variable (or y) is `leave_share`, which is the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit, or leaving the EU. Each row is a UK [parliament constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies).

To get a sense of the spread, or distribution, of the data, we can plot a histogram, a density plot, and the empirical cumulative distribution function of the leave % in all constituencies.

```{r brexit_histogram, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5)+
labs(title = "2016 UK Brexit Vote Results",subtitle="histogram",
       x = "leave_share(the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit)",
       y = "count(the number of constituencies)") +
   NULL

# density plot-- think smoothed histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_density()+
labs(title = "2016 UK Brexit Vote Results",subtitle="Probability Density Function",
       x = "leave_share(the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit)",
       y = "PDF") +
   NULL

# The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) 
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  labs(title = "2016 UK Brexit Vote Results",subtitle="Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function",
       x = "leave_share(the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit)",
       y = "ECDF") +
   NULL


```

One common explanation for the Brexit outcome was fear of immigration and opposition to the EU's more open border policy. We can check the relationship (or correlation) between the proportion of native born residents (`born_in_uk`) in a constituency and its `leave_share`. To do this, let us get the correlation between the two variables

```{r brexit_immigration_correlation}
brexit_results %>% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %>% 
  cor()
```

The correlation is almost 0.5, which shows that the two variables are positively correlated.

We can also create a scatterplot between these two variables using `geom_point`. We also add the best fit line, using `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`.

```{r brexit_immigration_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  
  # add a smoothing line, and use method="lm" to get the best straight-line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  
  # use a white background and frame the plot with a black box
  theme_bw() +labs(title = "2016 UK Brexit Vote Results by Constituency",subtitle="Correlation between proportion of native born residents(born_in_uk) & leave_share",
       x = "born_in_uk",
       y = "leave_share") +
  NULL
```

You have the code for the plots, I would like you to revisit all of them and use the `labs()` function to add an informative title, subtitle, and axes titles to all plots.

What can you say about the relationship shown above? Again, don't just say what's happening in the graph. Tell some sort of story and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> Generally, the higher the percentage of native born residents in a constituency, the higher the percent of votes cast in favor of Brexit. It seems that native born residents in the UK are more in favor of Brexit. Chances are that for native born residents, they believe Brexit can bring about more benefits(like better policies) to them.

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

[The London Fire Brigade](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress. The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries.

Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

```{r load_animal_rescue_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/f43b485e-fb35-419c-aa7a-fa75676e5835/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"


animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```

One of the more useful things one can do with any data set is quick counts, namely to see how many observations fall within one category. For instance, if we wanted to count the number of incidents by year, we would either use `group_by()... summarise()` or, simply [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html)

```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")

```

Let us try to see how many incidents we have by animal group. Again, we can do this either using group_by() and summarise(), or by using count()

```{r, animal_group_percentages}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  #group_by and summarise will produce a new column with the count in each animal group
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))


```

Do you see anything strange in these tables? 

> The number of rescues for domestic or pet animals is higher compared to wild animals.

Finally, let us have a loot at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals. As the LFB says,

> Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

There is two things we will do:

1.  Calculate the mean and median `incident_notional_cost` for each `animal_group_parent`
2.  Plot a boxplot to get a feel for the distribution of `incident_notional_cost` by `animal_group_parent`.

Before we go on, however, we need to fix `incident_notional_cost` as it is stored as a `chr`, or character, rather than a number.

```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```

Now that incident_notional_cost is numeric, let us quickly calculate summary statistics for each animal group.

```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

```

Compare the mean and the median for each animal group. what do you think this is telling us? Anything else that stands out? Any outliers?

> For common animals(like pet animals), the "mean_incident_cost" and "median_incident_cost" are much closer. This is because that the number of rescues conducted is large, so rescuers are more skilled at assisting or rescuing these kind of animals. For rare animals(like wild animals) or domestic animals with larger sizes, the "mean_incident_cost" is usually higher than the "median_incident_cost". Maybe for these animals in some rescuing cases the cost is extremely high than other common cases. An outlier is Ferret (I think we can seldom see a ferret). Its "mean_incident_cost" is lower than the "median_incident_cost". Maybe it is because the number of incidents/rescues is too small.

Finally, let us plot a few plots that show the distribution of incident_cost for each animal group.

```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

Which of these four graphs do you think best communicates the variability of the `incident_notional_cost` values? Also, can you please tell some sort of story (which animals are more expensive to rescue than others, the spread of values) and speculate about the differences in the patterns.

> The box plot. It clearly shows us the distribution of the cost by additionally visualizing the mean and the median.
>
>Generally, to rescue horses is more expensive than to rescue other animals. One reason is that horses are relatively bigger in size, thus costing more in injuriy treatment. Addtionally, horses need special care(which is expensive) for their hooves to help then live as usual.
