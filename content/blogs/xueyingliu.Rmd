```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(gapminder)  # gapminder dataset
library(here)
library(janitor)
```


The `gapminder` dataset has data on life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita for 142 countries from 1952 to 2007. To get a glimpse of the dataframe, namely to see the variable names, variable types, etc., we use the `glimpse` function. We also want to have a look at the first 20 rows of data.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)

head(gapminder, 20) 
# look at the first 20 rows of the dataframe

```

To produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the `country` and the `continent` I come from.

```{r}
country_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(country == "China") 

continent_data <- gapminder %>% 
            filter(continent == "Asia")
```

First, create a plot of life expectancy over time for the single country I chose. Map `year` on the x-axis, and `lifeExp` on the y-axis. 

```{r, lifeExp_China}
 plot1 <- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
   NULL 

 plot1
```

Next we need to add a title. Create a new plot, or extend plot1, using the `labs()` function to add an informative title to the plot.

```{r, lifeExp_China1}
 plot1<- plot1 +
   labs(title = "China_life expextancy over time",
       x = "year",
       y = "lifeExp") +
   NULL


 plot1
```

Secondly, produce a plot for all countries in the *continent* I come from. 

```{r lifeExp_Asia}
 ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x =year  , y = lifeExp, colour=country , group = country))+
   geom_point()+ 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   NULL
```

Finally, using the original `gapminder` data, produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent. We will remove all legends, adding the `theme(legend.position="none")` in the end of our ggplot.

```{r lifeExp_facet_by_continent}
 ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp , colour=continent ))+
   geom_point() + 
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
   facet_wrap(~continent) +
   theme(legend.position="none") + #remove all legends
   NULL
```

# Conclusion

> For China, the life expectancy has been growing since 1952. However, the speed of the growth of life expectancy in China decreased in the late 1970s. I think this is because since 1978, China's Reform and Opening-Up has begun, which has changed people's lifestyle and living standards to a certain extent and brought about the changes in the speed of growth of life expectancy.
>
> In Asia, the life expectancy in most countries has been growing since 1952. Since late 1960s, Japan has become the country with the highest life expectancy in Asia. Maybe it is because Japanese eats more healthily than people in other countries.
>
> As for different continents, the life expectancy for countries in Europe varies less, and the life expectancy for countries in Africa and Asia varies more. One possible reason is that most of the countries in Europe are well developed, and there is significant difference in the development levels in countries in Africa and Asia, which results in the difference of life expectancy.
