1.  I am completely a dog person. I have 2 dogs, a corgi and a teddy.

2.  I am a musical enthusiast (Now a West End enthusiast in London;\>). *Phantom of the Opera* used to be my favorite musical, but these days I have developed preference for *Les Misérables*...

3.  As for musicals in China, I am a big fan of Yunlong Zheng, who is a musical/modern drama actor.

4.  Classical music is attractive to me as well. *La Campanella* from Niccolò Paganini is my favorite. However, hip-pop looks good too...

5.  Who is the hottest girl on earth? It must be Jennie from Blackpink! (not a fan).

6.  I learned skiing by myself. I fell at least 30 times in one morning before I could ski freely on the snow.

7.  Compared to focusing on how to look fashionable, I would rather do research on what to eat for dinner.

8.  My family eats rice for 360 days out of 365 days in a year. Cannot live without rice ha!
